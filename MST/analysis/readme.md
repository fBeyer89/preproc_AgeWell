# MST task:

## To do the analysis on the logfiles:

- run the script run_ausw_1_neu.sh

...in the script you have to modify the path to where all the MST logfiles are located.

...This script wraps the command (perl  MST_ausw_1_neu.pl  Logfile (ohne Endung)) which extracts trial-by-trial the correct and given responses and writes them into .txt-files.

...These can then be further analyzed and summarized to the MST-scores (recognition + pattern separation) with the R script: analysis_MST_scores.R.
