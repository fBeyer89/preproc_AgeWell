# MST task:

## To do the analysis on the logfiles:

- run the script *run_ausw_1_neu.sh* to extract trial-by-trial the correct and given responses

   in the script you have to modify the path to where all the MST logfiles are located.

   This script wraps the command (perl  MST_ausw_1_neu.pl  Logfile (ohne Endung)) and writes results into .txt-files in the same location as the log-files.

- calculate the MST-scores (recognition + pattern separation) with the R script: *analysis_MST_scores.R*.
