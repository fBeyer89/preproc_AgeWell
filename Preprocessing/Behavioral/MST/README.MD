## Description
These files are used to run and analyze the **Mnemonic similarity task** in the AgeWell.de-MRI Study. This task is publicly available and described under https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/starklab/mnemonic-similarity-task-mst/.

## Folder Stucture

* The test was implemented in Presentation software version 16.5. To run, the whole folder **presentation_script** needs to be copied to a Presentation PC in the lab tract (already installed in RZ1,2 and 4). There, when starting presentation run MST.exp and MST_1.sce. Also see 20180911_MST_SOP_f√ºrAgeWell.docx and MST-testanweisung_agewell.pptx for more details on how to run and instruct the task. **Rando_Liste_MST.ods** is the randomization list so that participants would randomnly do one of the five subversions of the task. **images_for_instructions** were used to adapt the publicly available version of the test to our setup.

* Scripts to run the analysis are located in **MST analysis**. See README.MD in this folder.
